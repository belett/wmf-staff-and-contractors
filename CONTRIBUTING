CONTRIBUTING to wmf-staff-and-contractors
=========================================

This repo attempts to show the history of people working at the
Wikimedia Foundation over time. It does this by scraping publicly
available data on the current [staff-and-contractor page][0] and the
[old foundation wiki page][1]

The code to do the scraping is available under GPL-3.0 license at:
[https://github.com/thcipriani/wmffolks][2]

There is currently historical data still missing. This is mostly due to
the staff-and-contractor page being historically difficult to scrape
deterministically.

Pull requests to the [wmffolks repo][2] are *very* welcome :)
